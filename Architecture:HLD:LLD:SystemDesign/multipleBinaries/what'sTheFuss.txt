/*

Every executable will have its own main function. All the classes would be instantiated from here.

If you want to access an specific routine from multiple executables, that’s what libraries are used for.

Classes of an executable can communicate with each other. If they belong to different executables then IPC is required.

Always check which source file belong to which executable.
