/*

Each class gets the Virtual Table.
Virtual Table is a static Array where each element is a Function Pointer to the most derived function that the class can resolve.
Only Base class has the Virtual Pointer *__vptr. All Derived classes inherit it.
*__vptr automatically points to the Virtual Table of a class when the class is instantiated. 
When we call a Virtual Function using Pointer or reference to the Base class of a Derived object, *__vptr points to the Virtual Table of the Derived class, and the Virtual Table helps resolve the correct function.
